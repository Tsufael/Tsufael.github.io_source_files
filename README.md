# Uta Sanshin

This project is a collection of Ryuukyuu (Okinawa) folk songs lyrics

Sometimes it's hard to find some lyrics in written in romaji or kana and there isn't an online collection of ryuukyuuan songs lyrics I know of at the moment.

I hope this helps people who wants to sing along during uchinanchu people festivities around the world.
